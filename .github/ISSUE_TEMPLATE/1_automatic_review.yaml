        Hi :wave:,
        
        Speaking for the whole @docker/extensions, thank you for creating an extension and submitting it!
        
        Once you have filled the following form and submitted this issue, some automatic validations will run.
        
        :+1: If everything goes well, a new label `validation/succeeded` will be added and the @docker/extensions will be pinged. Later, someone from the team will add the `publish/ready` which will trigger an automatic job to publish the extension on the marketplace.
        
        :confused: If there are some issues, we will add the problems as comment and close the issue. Once you have fixed all the problems, re-open the issue and the process will start over.
